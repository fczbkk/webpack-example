# Intro to Webpack for frontend developers

* See Readme in each sub-folder for description.
* Run `npm install` and then `npm run build` in each sub-folder.
* Then go to `/build` folder to see the files generated by Webpack.
* You can peek into generated files at your own risk. Their content is ugly. But it works.
