# Transform non-JS files

* You can apply various transformation on imported files using modules and loader.
* E.g. optimize SVG files using [SVGO](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) during build.
* Compare SVG file from `/build` to the original from `/src`.
* See [list of useful loaders for Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/).
